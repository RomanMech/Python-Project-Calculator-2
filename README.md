# Python-Project-Calculator-2
This Calculator Responds To User Input Giving The User A Input Prompt Of A Choice Of Which Operator The User Would Like To Use, Whether It Is Addition (+) Subtraction (-) Multiplication (x) Division (/) Once The User Enters A Valid Operator The User Will Enter Two Numbers That They Want That Is Dedicated To The Users Choice Of Operator, When The Two Numbers Are Entered The Compiler Will Prompt The Sum Of Those Two Numbers In Accordance To The
Operator Used.

Then The Next Two Input Prompts Will Be For The First And Second Number The User Must Fill Out In Order To Continue, After This I Declare number_1 And number_2 As Floats Because When The Code Is Compiled I Don't Want The Compiler To Recognize The Users Number As A String And Just Combining Two Strings Together Instead By Declaring Each Variable As A Float The Compiler Will Recognize It As Two Seperate Numerical Values That Need To Be Added, Subtracted, Divided Or Multiplied

Next, I Utilize if Statements To Seperate Each Operator And It's Formula So Whichever Operator The User Uses The Compiler Will Scan Through The if Statements And Use The Formula Given To The Users Chosen Operator, I Also Use An Else Statement For The Use Of An Invalid Key So The User Can Only Use The Provided Operators (+, -, x, /) And If They Use An Invalid Key They Will Be Prompted With A Message To Use A Valid Key And The Key Entered Is Invalid. For The Prompt Of Each if Statement I Use A F-String To Store The Users Result Of Their Two Entered Numbers:

This Is My Second Python Project.
